## Personal / Team Wins

- installing and resolving dependencies [UX is better, provides feedback on whatâ€™s happening fast and effectively]

- feedback cycle is faster wrt `rake` tasks and `yarn run` tasks

- multiple minutes waiting became seconds / milliseconds

- and it actually resolved the right versions of packages with the lockfile, and made that transparent in VCS changes

- will make future updates much easier!
