## Personal / Team Wins

- improved UX when installing and resolving packages - provides feedback on whatâ€™s happening fast and effectively

- feedback cycle is faster wrt `rake` and `yarn run` tasks

- multiple minutes waiting became seconds / milliseconds

- and it actually resolved the right versions of packages with the lockfile, and made that transparent in VCS changes

- will make future updates much easier!
